## Naive Bayes Method

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, widely used for classification tasks. It assumes that the features used to describe an observation are conditionally independent, given the class label. Despite its simplicity and the "naive" assumption, Naive Bayes often performs well, especially in text classification and spam filtering scenarios.

In this repository, you will find an implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm, showcasing its versatility in handling classification tasks. Whether you are working on sentiment analysis, document categorization, or spam detection, Naive Bayes can be a powerful tool in your Machine Learning toolkit.

## Trend Moment Method

The Trend Moment method is a statistical approach designed for analyzing trends in time-series data. It aids in identifying patterns and tendencies over time, making it particularly useful for applications such as financial forecasting, stock market analysis, and other domains where understanding temporal trends is crucial.

Within this repository, you will discover an implementation of the Trend Moment method, highlighting its effectiveness in uncovering meaningful insights from time-series datasets. Whether you are exploring financial data to predict market trends or analyzing sensor data over time, the Trend Moment method can be a valuable asset in your data analysis pipeline.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the implementations, and integrate these methods into your own projects. If you have any questions, feedback, or contributions, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
